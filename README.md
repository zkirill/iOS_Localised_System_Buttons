# Localized iOS UIBarButtonSystemItem

This project originated from https://github.com/fastlane/snapshot/issues/321#issuecomment-164885778 where we discussed about the need of having localised UIBarButtonSystemItem for UITests.  
Intial reason for that was the usage of [fastlane's snapshot](https://github.com/fastlane/snapshot).
